# 🔧 Split Adjustment Fix - Documentation

## 🚨 Problem Identified

### The Issue
When calculating stock performance over time, **stock splits and reverse splits** were distorting the results, causing:

- **Reverse Splits (Contrasplits)**: Stocks appeared to have massive gains (e.g., +900%) when they actually had no real value change
- **Forward Splits**: Stocks appeared to have massive losses (e.g., -90%) when they actually had no real value change

### Real Example: NVIDIA (NVDA)
- **June 2024**: NVDA executed a 10:1 stock split
- **Before split**: ~$1,200 per share
- **After split**: ~$120 per share (10x more shares)
- **Real value change**: 0% (same total value)
- **What our system showed**: -90% loss ❌
- **What it should show**: Actual performance based on adjusted prices ✅

---

## ✅ Solution Implemented

### Change Made
Updated the Alpaca API call to use **split-adjusted prices**.

**Files Updated**:
1. `app/api/ai/create-portfolio/route.ts` (lines 536-543) - Portfolio creation
2. `app/api/ai/analyze-portfolio/route.ts` (lines 199-206) - Portfolio analysis  
3. `app/api/stocks/info/route.ts` (lines 46-58) - Stock information

### Before (Incorrect):
```javascript
const barsUrl = `https://data.alpaca.markets/v2/stocks/${candidate.symbol}/bars?` + 
  `start=${startDate.toISOString()}&` +
  `end=${endDate.toISOString()}&` +
  `timeframe=${barsTimeframe}&` +
  `limit=1000&` +
  `feed=iex`  // ❌ No split adjustment
```

### After (Correct):
```javascript
const barsUrl = `https://data.alpaca.markets/v2/stocks/${candidate.symbol}/bars?` + 
  `start=${startDate.toISOString()}&` +
  `end=${endDate.toISOString()}&` +
  `timeframe=${barsTimeframe}&` +
  `limit=1000&` +
  `feed=iex&` +            // ✅ IEX feed (free, supports adjustment)
  `adjustment=split`        // ✅ Adjust for stock splits/reverse splits
```

**Note**: Initially tried `feed=sip` but SIP requires a paid subscription. IEX feed is free and also supports the `adjustment` parameter.

## 📊 Technical Details

### What Changed

1. **Adjustment Added**: `adjustment=split`
   - Retroactively adjusts historical prices for splits
   - Ensures performance calculations are accurate
   - Standard practice in financial analysis

### How Split Adjustment Works

**Example: 10:1 Forward Split**

Without adjustment:
```
Day 1: $100 per share
Day 2: $10 per share (after split)
Calculated performance: -90% ❌ WRONG
```

With adjustment:
```
Day 1: $10 per share (adjusted retroactively)
Day 2: $10 per share (actual)
Calculated performance: 0% ✅ CORRECT
```

**Example: 1:10 Reverse Split**

Without adjustment:
```
Day 1: $1 per share
Day 2: $10 per share (after reverse split)
Calculated performance: +900% ❌ WRONG
```

With adjustment:
```
Day 1: $10 per share (adjusted retroactively)
Day 2: $10 per share (actual)
Calculated performance: 0% ✅ CORRECT
```

## 🎯 Impact

### Before the Fix
- ❌ Stocks with recent splits showed incorrect performance
- ❌ Reverse splits appeared as massive gains
- ❌ Forward splits appeared as massive losses
- ❌ AI recommendations were based on distorted data
- ❌ Users could receive portfolios with "fake winners"

### After the Fix
- ✅ All performance calculations are accurate
- ✅ Splits don't distort results
- ✅ AI recommendations based on real performance
- ✅ Users get portfolios with genuine top performers
- ✅ Comparable to professional financial analysis tools

## 🧪 Testing Recommendations

### Stocks to Test With (Known Splits in 2024)

1. **NVIDIA (NVDA)**: 10:1 split in June 2024
   - Should show actual performance (~+180% YTD), not -90%

2. **Chipotle (CMG)**: 50:1 split in June 2024
   - Should show actual performance, not -98%

3. **Walmart (WMT)**: 3:1 split in February 2024
   - Should show actual performance, not -67%

4. **Tesla (TSLA)**: Had splits in previous years
   - Should show accurate long-term performance

### Test Queries

```
"Show me the best performing tech stocks in the last year"
→ NVDA should appear with correct positive performance

"I want semiconductor stocks with highest growth"
→ Split-adjusted stocks should rank correctly

"Find stocks that have fallen the most this year"
→ Should NOT include stocks that just had forward splits
```

## 📈 Additional Considerations

### Dividend Adjustment (Future Enhancement)

Currently we adjust for **splits only**. We could also adjust for **dividends**:

**Current**: `adjustment=split`
**Alternative**: `adjustment=all` (splits + dividends)

**Pros of adding dividend adjustment:**
- More accurate "total return" calculation
- Includes reinvested dividends
- Better for comparing dividend vs growth stocks

**Cons:**
- May favor dividend stocks over growth stocks
- More complex to explain to users
- Not always desired for growth-focused strategies

**Recommendation**: Keep `adjustment=split` for now. Consider `adjustment=all` as a user preference in the future.

## 🔍 Alpaca API Documentation

### Adjustment Parameter Options

| Value | Description | Use Case |
|-------|-------------|----------|
| `split` | Adjust for stock splits only | ✅ **Current** - Recommended for most cases |
| `dividend` | Adjust for dividends only | Dividend-focused analysis |
| `all` | Adjust for splits + dividends | Total return calculation |
| (none) | No adjustment | ❌ Causes split distortion |

### Feed Parameter Options

| Feed | Description | Coverage | Cost | Adjustment Support |
|------|-------------|----------|------|-------------------|
| `iex` | Investors Exchange | Good | ✅ Free | ✅ Yes |
| `sip` | Securities Information Processor | Comprehensive | ❌ Paid subscription required | ✅ Yes |

**Note**: We use `iex` feed because it's free and supports the `adjustment` parameter. SIP feed requires a paid Alpaca subscription.

- Why split adjustment is critical
- Real-world example (NVDA split)
- What each parameter does
- Difference between feeds

This ensures future developers understand the importance of these settings.

## 🎊 Result

**This fix ensures that Mercurium provides accurate, professional-grade portfolio recommendations based on real stock performance, not distorted by corporate actions like splits.**

Users can now trust that when they ask for "best performing stocks," they get actual winners, not stocks that just happened to have a reverse split.
